## Base components

There are some base components for building apps built inside Respo:

```
respo.comp.space/comp-space
respo.comp.space/=< ; "which is an alias for `comp-space`"
respo.comp.inspect/comp-inspect
```

Also I got some simple component to help:

- [`respo-ui`](http://github.com/Respo/respo-ui) for base styles
- [`respo-value`](https://github.com/Respo/respo-value) for displaying values
- [`respo-router`](https://github.com/Respo/respo-router) for routering(Respo not required)
- [`global-popup`](https://github.com/Respo/global-popup) for global popups
- [`inflow-popup`](https://github.com/Respo/inflow-popup) for local popups(demo only)
- [`notifier`](https://github.com/Respo/notifier) for showing notifications(Respo not required)

Respo components are pure, without side effects.
